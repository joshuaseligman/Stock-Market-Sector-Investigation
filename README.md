# Stock Market Sector Investigation
 
In this project, I worked to improve my data analysis and visualization skills by completing an investigation on the performance of the different sectors of companies in the S&P 500.

Most of the skills used in this project I had minimal experience with, so my main focus was to get familiar with Jupyter notebooks and apply my basic knowledge to a much larger project. Using the cells in the Jupyter notebook allowed me to experiment to learn about how to use the libraries as well as investigate more with the data.

You can read more about my investigation process and conclusions in the Jupyter notebook.

Overall, this was a really fun and interesting project as I had never done an investigation like this before with data and I was able to express some of my interests in economics and business through a data science application.

In order to run the Jupyter notebook, begin by downloading the repository. Next, make sure that you have the following Python modules downloaded: jupyter, notebook, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, Beautiful Soup, and Yahoo Finance.

Next, make sure `juptyer` is added to PATH and then run the following command in your terminal:
### `jupyter notebook`

The Jupyter notebook page will open and then navigate to the downloaded notebook. In the notebook, you can run each cell to see the results that I obtained in my investigation.
